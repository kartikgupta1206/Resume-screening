# Resume-screening

In the modern recruitment landscape, the conventional process of manual resume screening has proven to be time-consuming and prone to biases. This project introduces an automated resume screening system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to efficiently filter and categorize resumes based on their relevance to specific job categories. The implementation incorporates advanced text preprocessing, label encoding, TF-IDF vectorization, and machine learning classifiers such as kNeighborsClassifier, Decision Tree Classifier and OneVsRestClassifier for accurate and efficient resume classification.
